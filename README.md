Real Time Web Application on Eye Strain Detection 

Prolonged screen exposure can lead to digital eye strain, causing discomfort
and reduced productivity. This project proposes an AI-powered web
application that monitors users in real time using computer vision techniques
to detect eye blinks and fatigue. The system provides alerts when blink
frequency is low or eyes remain closed for extended periods, helping users
manage screen time better and maintain eye health.
